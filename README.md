# TimeTable-Android-app
This is an TimeTable app for Android with main feature of Bluetooth Sync with other devices. i have excluded scroll view in order that students take snapshot and get printout. will add more features in the near future

USAGE:

On clicking any subject you will get a message about subject name followed by course name

On Long click you will get an alert dialogue in which you need to enter subject code and course name

To synchronize with other devices press the bluetooth icon at the top. if bluetooth was not on it will show an alert dialoge
to enable bluetooth. once enabled in both devices again press bluetooth icon and there is alert dialog activity showing 
paired devices. you can even search for new devices once paired try to connect to each other on both devices.

Once they are connected it will show a small toast message at the bottom saying connected to $device_name

After the connection you can synchronize time table on both devices. Enjoy!!
